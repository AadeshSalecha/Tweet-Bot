## Tweet Bot for Fake News Mitigation

Automatic Twitter Bot developed with the intention of texting users that potentionally could fall prey to Fake news. But, since this kind of a system would be in violation of Twitter policies, we abandoned the idea. This was exploratory work done prior to the techniques developed in *Detecting fake news spreaders in social networks using inductive representation learning*. This paper was published in the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM) 2020.
